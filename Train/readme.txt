ReverseArray https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reverse-an-array-without-affecting-special-characters/

Given a string, that contains special character together with alphabets (‘a’ to ‘z’ and ‘A’ to ‘Z’), reverse the string in a way that special characters are not affected.

Examples:

Input:   str = "a,b$c"
Output:  str = "c,b$a"
Note that $ and , are not moved anywhere.  
Only subsequence "abc" is reversed

Input:   str = "Ab,c,de!$"
Output:  str = "ed,c,bA!$"


Count Triplets
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-triplets-with-sum-smaller-that-a-given-value/
Given an array of distinct integers and a sum value. Find count of triplets with sum smaller than given sum value. Expected Time Complexity is O(n2).

Examples:

Input : arr[] = {-2, 0, 1, 3}
        sum = 2.
Output : 2
Explanation :  Below are triplets with sum less than 2
               (-2, 0, 1) and (-2, 0, 3) 

Input : arr[] = {5, 1, 3, 4, 7}
        sum = 12.
Output : 4
Explanation :  Below are triplets with sum less than 12
               (1, 3, 4), (1, 3, 5), (1, 3, 7) and 
               (1, 4, 5)
